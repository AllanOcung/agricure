## Machine Learning Model

The disease detection system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on plant disease images. The model can identify:

- Apple diseases (scab, black rot, cedar apple rust)
- Corn diseases (leaf blight, rust, leaf spot)
- Tomato diseases (early blight, late blight, leaf mold, etc.)
- Grape diseases (black rot, leaf blight)
- And many more plant diseases

Model architecture:

- Input: 256x256 RGB images
- Multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization
- Residual connections for better gradient flow
- Softmax output for multi-class classification

## API Endpoints

### Disease Detection

- `POST /diagnosis/dashboard/` - Upload image for diagnosis

### IoT Data

- `GET /iot/api/current/` - Get current sensor readings
- `GET /iot/api/historical/` - Get historical data

### Recommendations

- `GET /notifications/` - Get user notifications
- `POST /notifications/mark-as-read/<id>/` - Mark notification as read

## Configuration

### Email Settings

Configure email settings in `settings.py` for notifications:

- Gmail SMTP configuration
- App-specific passwords required
- Console backend for development

### Static Files

- Static files served during development
- Use WhiteNoise for production static file serving
- Media files handled separately

### Database

- SQLite for development (included)
- PostgreSQL recommended for production
- Migrations included for all models

## Deployment

### Production Settings

1. Set `DEBUG = False`
2. Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
3. Use PostgreSQL database
4. Set up proper email backend
5. Configure static file serving
6. Set up domain and SSL

### Environment Variables

```env
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/agricure
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## Development
